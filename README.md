# KnativeCon North America 2022 - Platform Building Demo

This repository contains the step-by-step instructions to run the KnativeCon NA Demo. 

The Platform that we built uses the following projects that you need to install in a Kubernetes Cluster: 
- Crossplane
- Knative Serving
- VCluster (will be automatically installed)
- ArgoCD

In this demo you will be able to request new Development Environments to the platform API.
